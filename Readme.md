# Installation

**Guide to Installing a Postman Collection of FHIR Queries**

In this guide, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of installing a Postman collection containing the FHIR search queries, along with the necessary environment files. These files are available in a Bitbucket repository, and we'll demonstrate how to clone them and set up your Postman environment for seamless query execution.

**Prerequisites:**
- Make sure you have Postman installed on your system. If not, you can download it from the official website: [Postman Download](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the `git clone` command to clone the Bitbucket repository containing the Postman collection and environment files:
     ```
     git clone https://bitbucketlb.iscinternal.com/scm/~pjamieso/fhirsearchglobalsummit.git
     ```

2. **Import Postman Collection:**
   - Open Postman on your system.
   - Click on the "Import" button located in the top left corner.
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and select the `FHIR_Search_Global_Summit.postman_collection.json` file.
   - Click "Open" to import the collection into Postman.

3. **Import Postman Environment:**
   - After importing the collection, click on the gear icon in the top right corner to access the "Manage Environments" option.
   - Click on the "Import" button and select the `FHIR_Search_Global_Summit.postman_environment.json` file from the cloned repository directory.
   - Click "Open" to import the environment into Postman.

4. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   - Once the environment is imported, you'll see it listed in the environments dropdown in the top right corner of Postman.
   - Click on the dropdown and select the imported environment.
   - Verify that the environment variables are correctly set up. These variables typically include base URLs, authentication tokens, etc., necessary for executing queries against your FHIR server.

5. **Execute Queries:**
   - With the collection imported and the environment set up, you're now ready to execute FHIR queries.
   - Select a request from the imported collection.
   - Ensure the appropriate environment is selected in the top right corner.
   - Click on "Send" to execute the query.
   - Review the response to ensure it meets your expectations.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the Postman collection of FHIR queries and set up the necessary environment files. You can now explore and execute various FHIR queries seamlessly using Postman, leveraging the power of interoperable healthcare data retrieval.
